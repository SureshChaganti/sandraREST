# Cassandra Communicator 

Cassandra is a NOSQL open source database that is used worldwide for
big data applications. It includes its own query language called CQL,
with a similar syntax to SQL. The target of the project is to create a web
application (with its client- and server-side components) that enables
users to connect, administer and query a Cassandra database,
presenting its results.

1. Ability to connect to a given database.
2. Presentation of the typical database metadata: keyspaces, tables, etc.
3. Ability to type a CQL query (syntax prediction is not expected).
4. Presentation of the query results (for instance, in a tabular form.
5. Error recovery.
6. The communication client-server is expected to happen via RESTful web services.

## Further issues:

1. Analyse in detail some use cases and the functionality of the
application. Document and present graphically the results.
2. Analyse in detail the use cases and workflow of the GUI.
Document and present graphically the results.
3. Implement and test all the components.

## Evaluation criteria
* Quality of the use cases analysis and modeling.
* Number of services implemented.
* Functionality of the application.
* Creativity of the GUI design.
* Coverage of the unit tests.

## Notes
1. Document adequately the results and the software, including the
installation process.
2. All the software must be delivered in a CD in a self-contained
Mavenized Java project with source code or as a stand-alone
node.js application..
3. A set of unit tests should be developed for the services.
